        <h1>Operators in Python</h1>
        <h2>What is an Operator?</h2>
        <p> In Python, an operator is one or more symbols used to perform actions on values. Some actions can be defining or causing change to values.</p>
        <h2>Different Types of Operators</h2>
        <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
        <p>These operators change values of given numbers or variables by adding(+), subtracting(-), multiplying(*), and dividing(/).</p>

        <p>These operators compair values of given numbers or variables by using equal to (=), less than(<), greater than(>), equal to or less than(<=), more than or equal to(>=), and not equal to(!=).</p>

        <h3>Assignment Operator</h3>
        <p>These operators are very similar to Arithmetic Operators but will assign values to variables instead using equal to (=), adding to the value (+=), subtracting from it (-=), multiplying the variable (*=), and dividing the number (/=)</p>

        <h3>Logical Operator</h3>
        <p>These operators use logic and then gives back a true or false respond depending if the statement you made is correct or not. It uses "and," "or," and "not"</p>
